What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

To be simple, it is when customers stops being your customer.

Telco churn data includes information about a fictitious telecom company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7,043 California customers in the third quarter. Which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service shows?

In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.
